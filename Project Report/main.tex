    \Large{\textbf{The ‘Drim’ Programming Language}}
\end{center}

\section{Project Overview}
\textbf{``Drim''} is a custom-built, interpreted programming language designed to run as a lightweight, headless command-line interface (CLI) application. Unlike standard compilers that translate source code into machine code, Drim functions as a \textbf{Tree-Walk Interpreter} that reads custom \texttt{.drim} source files, constructs an internal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and executes logic in real-time.

The project is built entirely from scratch using \textbf{C++ (Standard 17)}, adhering to strict constraints that prohibit the use of external parsing libraries (like Lex or Yacc) or heavy standard library functions (like \texttt{std::stoi} or Regex). This ensures that every component of the language pipeline—from lexical analysis to memory management—is engineered manually by the team.

The primary goal of the project is to create a functional programming environment that supports dynamic typing, mathematical operations, and custom control flow structures (such as \texttt{drimming} for loops and \texttt{wake} for output), providing a simplified yet robust platform for logic execution.

\newpage
\section{Motivation Behind the Project}
The motivation behind developing the Drim programming language is twofold: preserving classroom culture and mastering complex software engineering concepts.
\subsection*{Cultural Significance}
The name "Drim" originated as an inside joke and a shared meme within the student batch. Rather than letting this remain a fleeting concept, we decided to immortalize it by building a tangible software tool. This decision transforms the abstract nature of coding assignments into a personalized project where the syntax and keywords (such as drimming for loops) reflect the team’s unique personality. This connection increases developer engagement and passion for the project.
\subsection*{Engineering Challenges}
From a technical perspective, this project serves as a rigorous exercise in system-level programming. We chose to build an interpreter from scratch to accomplish three specific learning outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep Understanding of Language Design:} By manually implementing lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation, we gain firsthand experience with the inner workings of programming languages.
    \item \textbf{Memory Management Proficiency:} The project requires careful handling of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, fostering a strong grasp of pointers and resource management in C++.
    \item \textbf{Problem-Solving Skills:} Overcoming the constraints of not using third-party libraries or certain STL functions challenges us to devise innovative solutions for common programming tasks.
    \item \textbf{Collaboration and Project Management:} Working as a group on a complex software project enhances teamwork, version control practices, and project planning skills.
\end{itemize}



\newpage
\section{User Requirement}
\subsection*{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input/Output:} The system must accept user input via the \texttt{drim()} command and display formatted output using the \texttt{wake()} command.
    \item \textbf{Variable Management:} Users must be able to declare variables, assign values, and update them dynamically. The system must support implicit type casting between Strings and Integers.
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Operations:} The interpreter must correctly evaluate arithmetic expressions (\texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, \texttt{*}, \texttt{/}, \texttt{\%}) respecting standard operator precedence.
    \item \textbf{Control Flow:} The language must support conditional logic (\texttt{if/else}) and iterative loops (\texttt{drimming}) to execute repetitive tasks.
    \item \textbf{Script Execution:} The application must be able to read a text file with the \texttt{.drim} extension and execute the code contained within.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Headless Application:} The system must run entirely in the terminal (CLI) without a graphical user interface.
    \item \textbf{Performance:} The interpreter should parse and execute commands with minimal latency for standard script sizes.
    \item \textbf{Portability:} The source code should be cross-platform, compilable on Windows, macOS, and Linux using CMake.
    \item \textbf{Independence:} The implementation must not rely on any third-party parsing libraries or forbidden STL functions.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Key Feature}
The Drim language includes a set of custom features designed to balance simplicity with robust logic execution.
These features highlight the capabilities of the custom-built Tree-Walk Interpreter.\\ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Custom Syntax \& Semantics:} The language utilizes a unique set of keywords tailored to the project's theme. Notable examples include the \texttt{drimming}
                                                command for iterative loops and the \texttt{wake()} function for standard output. 
                                                This custom syntax demonstrates the flexibility of the Lexer design.
    \item \textbf{String Interpolation:} Unlike many basic custom languages that only supports simple stgring printing,
                                         Drim supports advanced intercpolation. Users can embed variables directly within string literals (e.g., \texttt{wake("Value: {x})}),
                                         allowing for dyunamic and readable output generation. 
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Typing:} Variables in \textbf{Drim} can hold either String or Integer values, with implicit type casting handled by the interpreter. 
                                    This feature simplifies variable management and enhances user experience.
    \item \textbf{Headless Execution:} Designed specifically as a backend tool, Drim runs as a lightweight, headless Command Line Interface (CLI) application. It executes scripts directly in the terminal without the overhead of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), meeting the requirement for high-performance logic processing.
    \item \textbf{Zero-Dependency Architecture:} A defining feature of Drim is its independence. It does not rely on third-party parsing libraries or heavy standard library tools (such as Regex). Every component, from tokenization to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) construction, is engineered manually using C++ 17.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection*{Process Description}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Source Code (.drim):} The raw text file provided by the user containing the custom script.
    \item \textbf{Lexer (Tokenizer):} Scans the source code character-by-character to generate a sequence of \textbf{Tokens} (Keywords, Identifiers, Literals).
    \item \textbf{Parser:} Analyzes the token sequence against the language grammar rules. It constructs an \textbf{Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)} composed of Statement and Expression nodes.
    \item \textbf{Interpreter:} Traverses the AST recursively. It executes Statements (actions) and evaluates Expressions (values), interacting with the \textbf{Environment} (Memory) to store and retrieve variable states.
    \item \textbf{Output:} The result of the execution is printed to the standard output (Console).
\end{enumerate}
